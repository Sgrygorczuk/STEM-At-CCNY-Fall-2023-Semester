## Week 5: Lab 2 - 2D Games and User Interface & Introdcution to C# ##
Putting the lessons to the test and creating our first 2D game while implementing ideas of User Interfaces. Students will create a two scene game wiht one scene being a main menu and a second that's gameplay. The student will also begin to learn about the basic elements of C# and how to use it to manipulate games.
